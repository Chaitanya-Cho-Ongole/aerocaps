AeroCAPS
========

Welcome to the documentation page for `AeroCAPS`, a primarily object-oriented Python 3 library used to generate
Class-A (:math:`G^0`, :math:`G^1`, :math:`G^2`) parametric surfaces for the design of aerodynamic vehicles. Though
aerodynamics was the main intended use case, the library is sufficiently generic to be used in a variety of
CAD applications.
